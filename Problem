As a simplified model, assume each directory may optionally contain two special files that contain information used to identify who must approve a change:
DEPENDENCIES files list the paths to other directories that its containing directory depends upon. Paths must be relative to the root directory of the source code repository. A directory is considered to be affected by a change if a file or directory in that directory or in one of its transitive dependencies is modified (including creation and deletion).
OWNERS files list the login names of all of the engineers who are able to approve changes affecting a directory. If there is no one listed in the OWNERS file or it does not exist then the parent directories OWNERS file should be applied.
For example, consider the following directory tree:
 x/
   DEPENDENCIES = "y\n"
   OWNERS = "A\nB\n"
 y/
   OWNERS = "B\nC\n"
   file
If a change modifies y/file, it affects both directories y (contains file) and x (depends on y). This change must at a minimum be approved by either B alone (owner of x and y) or both A (owner of x) and C (owner of y).
This tool will validates the correct people have approved the changes made to a set of files.
As an example, the following is expected to work on the example directory structure we have provided to you.
$ validate_approvals --approvers alovelace ghopper --changed-files src/com/twitter/follow/Follow.java src/com/twitter/user/User.java
Approved
$ validate_approvals --approvers alovelace --changed-files src/com/twitter/user/User.java
Insufficient approvals
